The dataset includes 521 images.
Objects2-3iYz are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1024x1024 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -34 and +34 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -18 and +18 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels
